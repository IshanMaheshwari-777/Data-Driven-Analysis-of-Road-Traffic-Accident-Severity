Analysis – Derived Columns

"Added Time_Period (derived from Time using hour ranges) to categorize accidents into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night for temporal trend analysis."
Added Exp_Order (ordinal encoding of Driving_experience) to numerically represent experience levels for modeling and correlation analysis.



Analysis – KPIs

Added Total Accidents (COUNT of all accident records) to measure overall accident frequency in the dataset.
Added Total Casualties (SUM of Number_of_casualties) to capture the total human impact across all reported accidents.
Added Serious Accidents % (COUNT of Serious Injury accidents ÷ Total Accidents × 100) to quantify the proportion of high-severity cases.
Added Fatal Accidents % (COUNT of Fatal injury accidents ÷ Total Accidents × 100) to measure the percentage of fatal outcomes.
Added Serious Injury % (COUNT of Serious Injury casualties ÷ Total Casualties × 100) to evaluate the share of serious injuries among all victims.
Added Slight Injury % (COUNT of Slight Injury casualties ÷ Total Casualties × 100) to assess the proportion of minor injuries.
Added Most Common Cause (MODE of Cause_of_accident) to identify the dominant behavioral or operational risk factor.



Analysis – Pivot Tables

"Added Accident Severity by Road Surface, Light Condition, and Weather to analyze how environmental conditions influence accident severity distribution."
"Added Accident Severity by Light Conditions to compare fatal, serious, and slight injuries under daylight and different darkness conditions."
Added Accident Severity by Cause of Accident to identify which behavioral factors are associated with higher fatal and serious outcomes.
Added Accident Severity by Type of Vehicle to examine how vehicle category influences severity distribution.
"Added Casualty Severity by Casualty Class to compare impact levels among Drivers, Passengers, and Pedestrians."
Added Accident Severity by Day of Week to evaluate temporal patterns in accident frequency and severity.
Added Accident Severity by Driving Experience to assess how experience level affects fatal and serious accident proportions.
Added Accident Severity by Age Band and Driving Experience (Exp_Order) to analyze interaction between driver age and experience level.
Added Severity Percentage (Serious + Fatal %) by Driving Experience to compare high-risk proportions across experience categories.



Dashboard – Implementation Log

"Added 7 Main KPI Cards including Total Accidents, Total Casualties, Serious Accident %, Fatal Accident %, Serious Injury %, Slight Injury %, and Most Common Cause to provide an immediate high-level severity overview."
"Calculated percentage KPIs (Serious %, Fatal %, Injury %) directly from pivot totals to ensure accuracy and consistency with dataset aggregates."
"Designed slicer panel with filters for Driving Experience, Accident Severity, Type of Vehicle, Day of Week, Weather, Road Surface, Light Condition and Surface Type to enable dynamic cross-analysis."
Ensured all slicers are connected to relevant pivot tables to maintain synchronized filtering across charts.
Created Pie Chart for overall Accident Severity distribution to visually highlight dominance of Slight Injuries (84.56%).
Created Radar Chart for Type of Vehicle vs Injury Severity to compare severity patterns across vehicle categories.
Created Donut Chart for Vehicle Type Severity Distribution to show proportional contribution by vehicle categories.
"Built Casualty Vulnerability Horizontal Bar Chart to compare Driver, Passenger and Pedestrian exposure across severity levels."
Designed Bubble Chart (Severity Risk vs Exposure by Driving Experience) to analyze relationship between accident volume and serious/fatal risk percentage.
Built Road Surface vs Accident Count 3D Column Chart to assess infrastructure-related risk distribution.
Created Combined Line + Column Chart for High-Risk Days analysis to compare total accidents with severity trend simultaneously.
Created Light Condition vs Severity Column Chart to assess accident patterns in Daylight vs Darkness conditions.
Designed Weather Condition Horizontal Bar Chart to evaluate environmental risk contribution.
"Standardized color coding across dashboard (Red = Fatal, Dark Blue = Serious, Orange = Slight) for consistent severity interpretation."
Applied darker professional theme and contrast-based KPI styling to enhance readability and executive presentation quality.
Removed gridlines and adjusted spacing for cleaner layout and dashboard alignment.
"Added chart titles reflecting analytical intent (e.g., ""Severity Risk vs Accident Exposure by Driving Experience"", ""High-Risk Days: Accident Severity Trends"")."
Validated that all charts reference pivot tables below dashboard to prevent range breakage during slicer interaction.
Verified that deleting unrelated rows does not affect dashboard since pivots reference fixed cleaned dataset range.
"Ensured all Grand Totals across charts equal 12,316 accidents for numerical consistency."
Confirmed KPI calculations match pivot table totals and percentage derivations.
